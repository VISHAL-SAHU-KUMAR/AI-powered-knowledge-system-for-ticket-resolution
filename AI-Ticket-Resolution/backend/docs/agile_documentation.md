## User Stories

### As a customer, I want to:
- Submit support tickets through a web interface
- Receive instant AI-powered responses to my queries
- View the status of my submitted tickets
- Get relevant solutions from the knowledge base

### As a support agent, I want to:
- View all submitted tickets in a dashboard
- See AI-suggested responses for tickets
- Manually override AI responses when needed
- Track ticket resolution metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Natural Language Processing for query understanding
2. Ticket classification and routing
3. Knowledge base search and retrieval
4. RESTful API for frontend-backend communication
5. Database storage for tickets and user data

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Response time under 2 seconds for AI queries
2. System uptime of 99.5%
3. Secure authentication and data protection
4. Scalable architecture to handle increasing load
5. Mobile-responsive user interface
